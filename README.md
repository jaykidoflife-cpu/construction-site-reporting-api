Construction Site Reporting API Project

## Overview
This project explores how API technology can be used to automate construction site reporting and data management.  
As a Site Engineer, I manage daily activities such as supervision, material tracking, and cost documentation.  
This project aims to design a digital workflow that reduces manual data entry and enhances accuracy.

## Objectives
- Automate daily site reporting using structured data inputs.  
- Track materials, labor, and equipment activities in real-time.  
- Generate organized reports that can be shared with clients and supervisors automatically.  

## Tools & Technologies
- API integration (testing with Anthropic API)
- Python (for data processing)
- Excel / Google Sheets (for structured output)
- Webhooks for field data automation

## Purpose
This is a research and development project aimed at testing the role of APIs in improving efficiency and data transparency in construction management.
